# Tales of Soplicowo

## Case study

### Initial attempt

Previous design process started as an attempt to move the gameplay from
*The Witcher 2* and create a quite small game with a totally different story.
The story was supposed to be a core and all the gameplay mechanics were no such
important.

### Second attempt

Started accumulating gameplay ideas first, then creating the game world.
(Re)writing story in the end.
