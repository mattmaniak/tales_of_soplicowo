   "Don't be told what games must be. Instead find new and different types of games."  
   ~Hideo Kojima

   As the title suggests, those are only inspirations and won't be copied directly. It's just a list of key elements those seem to be fitting to our idea.
   - *AER Memories of Old* - minimalistic graphical design with faceless characters.
   - *Disco Elysium* - engaging dialogue trees instead as a combat.
   - *Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice* - environmental puzzles and personal narration.
   - *Horizon Zero Dawn* - specific save points only.

## <a id='development'></a>Development
1. ### <a id='technologies'></a>Technologies
   The newest Python 3.8/3.9, Panda3D engine with it's RenderPipeline.
2. ### <a id='assets-budget-summary'></a>Asset Budget Summary
   The less the better.

## <a id='gameplay'></a>Gameplay
The player acts as a priest whose goals is to go through the quests which are strictly related with Polish noble-class and *Sir Thaddeus* events. The goal is to persuade them to reunion. It will be done via helping them during various tasks from the Mickiewicz's book and deep talks about the Commonwealth. Optionally, the player will have to find and repair chapels.

To solve those problems, player will have to explore levels those will be labirynths with various paths to go through. They will be somehow connected with a camera's fixed pitch and base on the problem of getting into some kind of relatively complex place.

1. ### <a id='key-mechanics'></a>Key Mechanics
   - Constantly jump between Robak's life and Jacek's interactive memories those dialogue choices will affect Priest's behaviour.
   - Explore invisible level labirynths to find your path as the Priest or as Jacek.

   Both Jacek's and Robak's world will be dualistic, however there will be only one predominant style for each. Jacek's memories will include dark fantasy elements. Also there will be subtle positive stuff as he was a young vagrant. Robak's real world will be wonderfully colorful and inspired by high fantasy. On the other side, it will be still an occupied motherland.

2. ### <a id='#core-low-level-loop'></a>Core (Low-level) Loop
   1. Walk.
   2. Go Back.
   3. Repeat.

3. ### <a id='high-level-loop'></a>High-level Loop
   1. Let the level guide you via labirynth.
   2. Enter one of the memories.
   3. Choose your path via dialogues and exploration.
   4. Enter next level as a Robak or Jacek and continue your internal journey.

4. ### <a id='approach'></a>Approach
   It will be somehow mix of systemic and directed approach: on the one hand, it will allow player to use mechanics on their own, like various exploration possibilities and dialogue choices, on the other hand, the game won't have much mechanics (above two only) so the directed approach will be present too.

5. ### <a id='modularity'></a>Modularity
   The gameplay will be a little modular only, as there will be labirynth and NPCs conversations as the cores. These mechanics modules will overlap.

6. ### <a id='core-number'></a>Core Number
   Core number of the game should be 2 multiplications to symbolise a dualism everywhere, eg. there should be two ways to get into an area, two dialogue answers...

7. ### <a id='moscow-analysis-of-mechanics'></a>MoSCoW analysis of mechanics:
   - **Must have**:
     - High third-person perspective camera with a fixed pitch angle.
     - Comperhensive dialogue trees with short option and truly story-changing lines to reduce translations costs.
     - Mandatory but various time limit for dialogues with a possibility to skip an answer in order to **favour human connection**.
     - Reputation system.
     - Detailed and dense world.
     - Auto save during specific story moments.
     - *Press any button to continue* after loading screens.
   - **Sould have**:
     - Day-night cycle that changes gameplay and mostly negative night consequences.
     - In-door visibility - transparent portal on player or buildings half-transparency.
     - Basic in-game menu with: map, reputation graph, skills and current quest description.
     - Symbolic hints: icons, GIFs, sounds to represent settings differences and visualise invisible.
     - Compass.
   - **Could have**:
     - Basic economy for repair stuff trade.
     - Time skip only near repaired chapels.
     - Chapels repair and manual save possibility near them.
     - Courier's backpack when carrying repair tools.
   - **Won't have**:
     - Shoulder third-person perspective camera.
     - Minimap.
     - Combat.
     - Stealth.
     - Random encounters.
     - All unique *Sir Thaddeus* characters.

8. ### <a id='winning-and-losing'></a>Winning and Losing
   It's inevitable that a player could get lost, however this particular scenario will be quite similar to the deep exploration. Quite similar scenario will appear when a player will explore levels enough, there will be the same chance to gain a prize.

9. ### <a id='prizes'></a>Prizes
   There will be a chance to find something that will enhance the historical lore and/or add additional dialogue.

10. ### <a id='statistics-of-the-player'></a>Statistics of the Player
    The game shouldn't be explicit with stats displaying them by numbers. Instead, it should use some graphs and mainly storytelling to show characters' parameters. Here comes the *show, don't tell* rule.
   
    Optionally, there will be a reversed triangle that symbolises main character's attitude. Center will be the initial neutrals state. Left corner will symbolise Horeszko family, while right one - Soplicas. Collaboration with Russians will be placed at the bottom. As the protagonist is one of the Soplicas, player's attitude may be prejudiced, however to reconceal noblemen and thus succeed, neutrality will be necessary. Those attitudes will be the essence of the RPG loyality system, however it may judge player's morality so it should be considered deeply before optional implementation. This would trick player as working with Soplicas will be suggested at first sight, even if they won't be too familiar. Because of that, player probably will try to become neutral, and tho will probably achieve a relative success.

11. ### <a id='progression'></a>Progression 
    Note that each further labirynth and dialogue should be harder to provide a customizable progression system with a progressive difficulty.

    **Game's content and progression chart here.**

## <a id='characters'></a>Characters
There should be 12 characters, excluding the players. Each of them should be connected with exactly of the 12 Jungian archetypes. One of them will by same as the player's archetype as opposition.

   - **Father Robak** a.k.a. **Jacek Soplica** - a catholic priest, ex-vagrant.

   - #### Soplicas
      - **Protazy Brzechalski**.
      - **Tadeusz Soplica** - title character
      - **Judge Soplica** - mentor archetype - conservative Pole stereotype.

   - #### Horeszkos
      - **Count Horeszko** - Dandelion from *The Witcher*.
      - **Zosia Horeszkówna** - maiden archetype - Tadeusz's crush.
      - **Gerwazy Rębajło**.

## <a id='world'></a>World

1. ### <a id='environment'></a>Environment
   ...should not only perform as a static world component, but also as a dynamic narrative tool. Using various intense and distinctive weather types will according to the present events willprovide additional background and experence.

2. ### <a id='map'></a>Map
   Contains some levels on the single map. It will be important storytelling and reputation system component too - some places will be unavailable, while other will be available according to the player choices.

## <a id='Story'></a>Story
There is no distiction between and side jobs to simplify implementation. There will be nonlinear main quests only whose will have optional tasks sometimes to provide more diverse choices and consequences.

1. ### <a id='timeline'></a>Timeline
   A distinctive element will be that the game will use the Monomyth in the case of Priest Robak and an inverted Monomyth in Jackes's story. Initially, the player will start from the same moment in 1811, and then will go through the Robak's events traditionally and Jacek's events from this point to the past.

   Some tracks. Must be interactive and adaptive as games are interactive medium.
2. ### <a id='effects'></a>Effects
   Simple free assets.

## <a id='graphics'></a>Graphics
3D low poly pixel art, where pixels are used only for details. Meshes and the textures' context are classicaly flat. Rich post-processing can be easily achieved due the Render Pipeline.
1. ### <a id='art-direction'></a>Art Direction
   Beautiful.

## <a id='controls'></a>Controls
Easy.

## <a id='accessibility'></a>Accessibility
Each in-game feedback is expressed via at least two sensitive events, eg. dialogues use subtitles and narrator, enemies distraction - some character outline and a proper sound. Visual effects change it's shape, not color only to provide meaningful experience also for color-blind people. Most of the information is shown using mix of various visual and sound effects. Also the game should support at least custom mappings for: keyboard + mouse and Xbox, PlayStation pads. Game controls should be as much analogue as possible, eg. triggers on pads. The game should contain full colorblind-friendly only visuals optionally.

Context subtitles [jazz music in backround].

## <a id='miscellaneous'></a>Miscellaneous
- Easter eggs?
- Some kind of metagame?
- Negative emotions per contrast?
- Gameplay aided by Jacek/Robak.
- The game should contain verisimilitude.
- Convert this doc to a future tense!
